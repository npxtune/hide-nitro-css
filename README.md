# QuickCSS File to hide Nitro Ads in Discord

Use the CSS file this way:

- Vencord:
Add the URL to your themes:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/npxtune/hide-nitro-css/main/hideNitro.css
```
This should always fetch the latest version of the CSS from this GitHub repo.

If something does not work or buttons are being removed that should be shown, create an isse.

Enjoy and cheers
